In this webinar, Ivan will compare the performance and features of InfluxDB and Elasticsearch for common time-series workloads, specifically looking at the rates of data ingestion, on-disk data compression, and query performance. Come hear about how Ivan conducted his tests to determine which time-series db would best fit your needs.
