Between 2007 to 2016, the team built successful HP software products such as brand new Enterprise Maps and kept on releasing multiple Systinet major versions, too. Customers are large global corporations ranging from banking, telecommunications, the insurance industry, and governments.

| **2013** | Being all in on the brand new unique product **HPE Enterprise Maps**, **Service Virtualization**, CSA, Openstack or even **Propel**, we do really live the sweet illusion it is possible to build new startup inside a huge corporation |
| **2016** | The public still thinks HP is printer, HP splits itself into multiple companies and continues increasing business value at stock markets. We feel the strong need to cross the bridge from big corporation to a new era of our professional lives |
