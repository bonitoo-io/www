## Python Client Library

If you want to start with monitoring in Python, [Getting Started with Python and InfluxDB v2.0](https://www.influxdata.com/blog/getting-started-with-python-and-influxdb-v2-0/) written by Anais Dotis-Georgiou is a good start, then jump to [README.md](https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb-client-python)

## Javascript Client Library

There is a cool article written by Nicolas Bohorquez -- [Getting Started with JavaScript and InfluxDB - The New Stack](https://thenewstack.io/getting-started-with-javascript-and-influxdb/)

After reading what is possible, and need a boilerplate for the generic node.js based monitoring app, follow up with [IoT Center v2](https://github.com/bonitoo-io/iot-center-v2) out. It is a huge time saver!
